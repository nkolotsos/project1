# Project 1 - My Wordle
-------------------
## Description
Wordle is a popular word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. In this project, I have developed a web-based version of the game called "My Wordle."





☐ The code for a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages (covered next week).

A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!
